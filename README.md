oh hi this is a map made by some idots kthxbye


download the map using the releases shown on the right side

if you want to get the most recent version (commits), follow these steps:
- download the entire repo as a ZIP,
- extract all,
- take the inner folder out of the extracted folder
- send the folder you just took out to a compressed ZIP. you can do this by right clicking, finding "Send to...", hovering and clicking ZIP.
- After you zip it, be sure to change the .zip to .mcworld

if you know your git stuff
- you can clone the git repo into the worlds folder
- you can create a new world, then just copy the name. you can delete the world afterwards.
- after you do this, if you want to update the world, you can git pull. this will overwrite your world, however.
